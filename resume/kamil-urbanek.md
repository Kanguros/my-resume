    I've started in/at the bottom of a food chain as a Engineer in Master Control Room team, after a while I changed it to being a *secretary* of a Network Squad Product/Owner. As time pass by, I learned that my laziness have different meanings: Network Automation and DevOps. From that day, I'm trying to tell everyone around me why and how to do it.
