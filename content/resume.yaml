  summary: 'I''ve started in/at the bottom of a food chain as a Engineer in Master
    Control Room team. After a while I changed it to being a *secretary* of a Network
    Squad Product/Owner. As time pass by, I learned that my laziness have different
    meanings: Network Automation and DevOps. From that day, I''m trying to tell everyone
    around me why and how to do it.'
